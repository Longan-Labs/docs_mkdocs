## ***Introduction***

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Longan-Labs/docs_mkdocs/master/docs/images/1011010/1011001-1.jpg)

The Light sensor card features TEMT6000 ambient light sensor. It is sensitive to the visible spectrum. With Longan Light sensor card, you can bring the ability to detect light level to any project. 

The Light sensor on the Light sensor card will detect the brightness of its surroundings. The TEMT6000 measures illuminance in lux (lx) which is one of the properties of brightness.

The Light sensor card supports two wire I2C bus interface.

The front of the Light sensor card has following components.

* TEMT6000 silicon NPN epitaxial planar phototransistor
* 30 Gold fingers (30 pin edge connector)
* I2C extension connectors
* I2C and UART test point
* ATmega 168P module card

## ***Specifications***
* Voltage: 5V
* Adapted to human eye responsivity
* Wide angle of half sensitivity ϕ = ± 60°
* Supports two wire I2C bus interface	




## ***I2C Address***
The Light sensor card at the factory default I2C address of 0x0A. The factory default I2C address is printed on the back of the card.
 

Pins
Pins¶
The edge connector (gold fingers) has total of 30 contacts (each side has 15 contacts).

On the front side of the Light sensor card, a white arrow is printed near the edge connector indicates the pin #1. You can find some pin numbers printed on the edge connector itself (1, 15, and 29). You can count the pin numbers starting with 1 and count by twos from right to left would be 1, 3, 7, 9, 11, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 27, and 29. Notice that all the counts are odd numbers.



On the back side of the Light sensor card, you also can find some pin numbers printed on the edge connector itself (2, 16, and 30). You can count the pin numbers starting with 2 and count by twos from left to right would be 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28 and 30. Notice that all the counts are even numbers.



Among the 30 pins, following pins can be used for I2C communication.
•	SDA: Digital I/O, I2C bus serial bidirectional data line (Front: pin #5, #25 / Back: pin #6, #26)
•	SCL: Digital Input, I2C bus serial clock input (Front: pin #7, #23 / Back: pin #8, #24)
Also, following pins connect with the common power bus of the board.
•	VCC: Power supply (Front: pin #1, #29 / Back: pin #2, #30)
•	GND: To be connected to the system ground (Front: pin #3, #27 / Back: pin #4, #28)


### ***I2C Bus and UART Test Point***
You can solder a break away header (straight, 0.1” pin spacing) to the I2C bus test point. The I2C bus requires two wires to communicate with the device, a serial data line (SDA) and a serial clock line (SCL). There is an additional RX, TX, VCC, and GND that is not part of the I2C interface.


How to Use
The Light sensor card can be plugged into an edge connector slot of one of the following Longan boards.
•	Game board
•	Car board
•	Sensor board
•	Extension board
•	PI Hap

When plugging, the white arrow head printed on the card should be pointing toward the white arrow head printed near the edge connector slot of the board.
Once plugged, it can communicate with the Carduino through the I2C bus line of the board. It will also connect to the common power bus of the board.

Use with Extension Board
You can use the extension board to connect any Longan card with the Carduino.
•	First take the Extension board.
•	Next, plug the Light sensor card in to one of the edge connector slot.
•	Then plug the Carduino in to another edge connector slot.
•	Finally, connect the extension board with your computer using a Type-C USB cable (you can use either USB connector on the Carduino or the Extension board).

Reading Illuminance
The sample code can be loaded to your Arduino IDE by clicking on File > Examples > LonganCards > ReadSensor.
 
Connect the Type-C USB cable to the USB connector of the Carduino and connect the other end to your computer.

Next, tell the Arduino IDE to use the Carduino. To do this, click Tools > Board > Carduino 32U4 under Longen AVR Boards.
 
Then select the proper port in Tools > Port > (the Serial/COM port of your Carduino).
 


Next, upload the program by clicking Sketch > Upload.
 



It will take some time to compile and upload the sketch in to the Carduino.

If you have trouble loading the Blink sketch from the examples, you can copy and paste the code below into the Arduino editor.

#include <Wire.h>
#include "CardsDfs.h"
#include "LonganCards.h"

CARD_INFO card;

int addr = 0;
int cntSensor = 0;

float sensorValue[10];

float str2num(unsigned char *str)
{
    float num = 0;
    memcpy((unsigned char *)(&num), str, 4);
    return num;
}

void setup() {
    // put your setup code here, to run once:
    Serial.begin(115200);
    Wire.begin();
    
    while(!Serial.available());
    
    addr = card.scan();
    if(0 == addr)
    {
        Serial.println("NO DEVICE!");
        while(1);
    }
    
    card.getInfo();
    card.disp();
    
    cntSensor = card.senCnt;
}

void loop()
{
    for(int i=0; i<cntSensor; i++)
    {
        sensorValue[i] = getValue(i);
        Serial.print(sensorValue[i], 2);
        Serial.print('\t');
    }
    
    Serial.println();
    delay(100);
}

float getValue(int s)
{
    unsigned char dta[10];
    unsigned long len = 0;
    
    Wire.beginTransmission(addr);
    Wire.write(REG_VALUE_START+s);      // ADDR_DATA_START = 0x30
    Wire.endTransmission();
    
    delay(1);
    Wire.requestFrom(addr, 6);
    
    delay(1);
    
    while(Wire.available())
    {
        dta[len++] = Wire.read();
    }
    
    return str2num(&dta[1]);
}

// END FILE



Once uploaded, open the Serial Monitor by clicking Tools > Serial Monitor.
 

In the Serial Monitor, type any number or character and click Send button.

 

First, it will output the device information of your Light sensor card such as I2C address, device id, number of sensors, name length, name, SKU, and version. Then it will continually output the illuminance in lux (lx).
The blue LED on the ATmega 168P module will blink quickly and continually during the illuminance reading through I2C.
