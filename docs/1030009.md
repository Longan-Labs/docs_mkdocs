## ***Introduction***
--------------------------

[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Longan-Labs/docs_mkdocs/master/docs/images/1030009/db9.jpg)]()


CANBed FD is a CAN FD dev board with Atmega32U4 microcontroller inside, which has **32KB** of Flash and **2.5KB** of RAM. The operating frequency is **16MHz**, which can meet most embedded applications. There's **Arduino Leonardo bootloader** inside the **Atmega32U4**. If you have used the Arduino IDE, programming will not be a problem for you. You can also use AVR Studio for development, we provide ICSP interface.

CANBed FD uses **MCP2517FD** as CAN controller and **MCP2542** (*MCP2557*) as CAN receiver, chich are high-performance CAN Bus chip, can work in both CAN 2.0 and CAN FD protocols at the same time. There is a Micro USB connector on the board, through which you can program the board or supply power to the board.There are one I2C, one UART, one SPI interface, 3 analog input interfaces and 8 digital IO on the board.

We use a flexible way for CAN interface. You can use 4PIN Terminal or DB9 connector. DB9 connector uses OBD-II mode by default. You can also configure CAN Open mode on the hardware. The voltage input range of the CAN interface is 9-28V, which can provide a stable 5V/1A output.

If you want to use this board to develop OBD related applications, click to get a [DB9 to OBD-II cable](https://www.longan-labs.cc/2020011.html). 

!!!Note
    For transportation considerations, the plug-in components of the kit are not soldered by default. After you receive the kit, you need to do some soldering work. If necessary, you can also contact info@longan-labs.cc after purchasing the board, then we can send it to you after the board is soldered well.

## ***DB9 connector***

The DB9 interface of CAN Bus has two different protocols, OBD and CAN Open. Their definition is as follows,

|pin#|OBD(default)|CAN OPEN|
|----|----|-----------|
|1|GND|N.C|
|2|GND|CAN_L|
|3|CANH|GND|
|4|N.C|N.C|
|5|CANL|GND|
|6|N.C|N.C|
|7|N.C|CAN_H|
|8|N.C|N.C|
|9|CAN_V+|CAN_V+|

If you want to use the OBD protocol, you don't need to make any changes to the hardware.

If you need to use the CAN Open protocol, first we look at the back side of the PCB board, you can see the Pads below,

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Longan-Labs/docs_mkdocs/master/docs/images/1030009/CANBED_FD_DB9_SETTING.jpg)

These pads are connected to the OBD side by default. We have to prepare a knife to disconnect the OBD side, and then use an electric soldering iron to solder the CAN Open side of the pads.

## ***Getting Started***
--------------------------

Here we use the Arduino IDE as a demonstration, through this chapter you can learn how to get started with CANBed FD.
You need a micro USB cable to connect the CANBed FD Dev board to the computer.


### ***IDE and Driver***

There's Arduino leonardo bootloader in the board. 

Click to get the [latest Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software). 

There's Arduino Leonardo driver in the folder: Arduino/drivers.

### ***Download the install the library***

[Click](https://github.com/Longan-Labs/Longan_CANFD) to get the Arduino Library for CANBed FD Dev board. 

In the Arduino IDE, navigate to Sketch > Include Library > Add .ZIP Library to install the Library. 


### ***Open the code and upload it to the board***

Open the Arduino IDE, here we open the CAN20_Send example. This example can continuously send data to the CAN Bus.

```Arduino
// MCP2517/8 send a CAN frame
// CAN FD Shield - https://www.longan-labs.cc/1030012.html
// CANBed FD - https://www.longan-labs.cc/1030009.html

#include <SPI.h>
#include "mcp2518fd_can.h"

// pins for CAN-FD Shield
//const int SPI_CS_PIN = 9;
//const int CAN_INT_PIN = 2;

// pins for CANBed FD
const int SPI_CS_PIN = 17;
const int CAN_INT_PIN = 7;

mcp2518fd CAN(SPI_CS_PIN); // Set CS pin

void setup() {
    Serial.begin(115200);
    while(!Serial){};

    while (CAN_OK != CAN.begin(CAN_500KBPS)) {             // init can bus : baudrate = 500k
        Serial.println("CAN init fail, retry...");
        delay(100);
    }
    Serial.println("CAN init ok!");
}

unsigned char stmp[8] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7};

void loop() {

    CAN.sendMsgBuf(0x01, 0, 8, stmp);
    delay(10);
    CAN.sendMsgBuf(0x04, 0, 8, stmp);
    delay(500);                       // send data per 100ms
    Serial.println("CAN BUS sendMsgBuf ok!");
}

// END FILE
```

You need to select ***Arduino Leonardo*** on the Arduino IDE boards and select the correct COM port. Then you can upload the program to the CANBed FD Dev board by pressing the Upolading button on Arduino IDE.

## ***Get data from a Vehicle***

We can use CANBed to get data from a vehicle, we take the vehicle speed for an example here. 

You can use our products to read data from cars. Here we provide a simple example by which you can read the speed and revs from a car. This is the [OBD-based PIDs protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OBD-II_PIDs). Regarding the deeper technology of OBD, we can't provide support at present. You may need to have some understanding of the car's protocol. After all, we are more of a hardware supplier.


The interface of OBD is as follows,

![](https://www.longan-labs.cc/media/wysiwyg/CAN-Bus-Case-Dimension/Case-Dimension-07.png)

There're 4 pins we need to connect.

|OBD Pin|CANBed PIN|
|-------|----------|
|5. Signal Ground|GND|
|6. CAN(J-2234) High|CANH|
|14. CAN(J-2234) Low|CANL|
|16. Battery Power|VIN|

You can also use our [OBD-II to DB9 Cable](https://www.longan-labs.cc/2020011.html), which is very convenient to connect to OBD.

Upload the following code to the development board, then open the serial monitor, you get the speed from the car now.


```Arduino
#include <SPI.h>
#include "mcp2518fd_can.h"

// pin for CAN-FD Shield
//const int SPI_CS_PIN = 9;
//const int CAN_INT_PIN = 2;

// pin for CANBed FD
const int SPI_CS_PIN = 17;
const int CAN_INT_PIN = 7;

mcp2518fd CAN(SPI_CS_PIN); // Set CS pin

#define PID_ENGIN_PRM       0x0C
#define PID_VEHICLE_SPEED   0x0D
#define PID_COOLANT_TEMP    0x05

#define CAN_ID_PID          0x7DF

unsigned char PID_INPUT;
unsigned char getPid    = 0;

void set_mask_filt() {
    CAN.init_Filt_Mask(0, 0, 0x7E8, 0x7FC);
}

void sendPid(unsigned char __pid) {
    unsigned char tmp[8] = {0x02, 0x01, __pid, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0};
    CAN.sendMsgBuf(CAN_ID_PID, 0, 8, tmp);
}

bool getSpeed(int *s)
{
    sendPid(PID_VEHICLE_SPEED);
    unsigned long __timeout = millis();

    while(millis()-__timeout < 1000)      // 1s time out
    {
        unsigned char len = 0;
        unsigned char buf[8];

        if (CAN_MSGAVAIL == CAN.checkReceive()) {                // check if get data
            CAN.readMsgBuf(&len, buf);    // read data,  len: data length, buf: data buf

            if(buf[1] == 0x41)
            {
                *s = buf[3];
                return 1;
            }
        }
    }

    return 0;
}

void setup() {
    Serial.begin(115200);
    while(!Serial);

    while (CAN_OK != CAN.begin(CANFD_500KBPS)) {             // init can bus : baudrate = 500k
        Serial.println("CAN init fail, retry...");
        delay(100);
    }
    Serial.println("CAN init ok!");
    set_mask_filt();
}

void loop() {

    int __speed = 0;
    int ret = getSpeed(&__speed);
    if(ret)
    {
        Serial.print("Vehicle Speed: ");
        Serial.print(__speed);
        Serial.println(" kmh");
    }
    delay(500);
}

// END FILE
```
If you want to get other data by PIDs, you can refer to the above example, and refer to [this link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OBD-II_PIDs)
