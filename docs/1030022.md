## ***Introduction***
--------------------------

[![](https://www.longan-labs.cc/media/catalog/product/cache/ecd051e9670bd57df35c8f0b122d8aea/1/0/1030022-1.jpg)](https://www.longan-labs.cc/1030022.html)


A few years ago, we released a popular CAN Bus development board called CANBed. Many users have completed their own projects using this development board and shared their projects with us. We noticed that some users needed to make their own enclosure, either using 3D printing or a cardboard box.

Today, we are excited to announce the release of the CANBed with an aluminum housing. Like the original CANBed, this version features an Atmega32U4 microcontroller, MCP2515 and MCP2551 chips, and supports USB power supply or 7-28V DC input.

In the future, we will continue to release additional versions, including the RP2040 version and CAN-FD series products.


### ***Possible Applications***

This CAN Bus dev kit can be used for the following purposes:

1. Learning about CAN Bus communication
2. Building product prototypes, and integrating the completed prototype into a final product with assistance from the manufacturer
3. Reading data from a car's systems
4. Incorporating into a final product as a complete MCU and CAN Bus solution, requiring only external hardware design.

## ***Getting Started***
--------------------------

In this section, we will demonstrate how to get started with CANBed using the Arduino IDE. You will need a micro USB cable to connect the CANBed FD development board to your computer.

### ***IDE and Driver***

There is an Arduino Leonardo bootloader on the board.

To get the latest Arduino IDE, click [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).

The Arduino Leonardo driver can be found in the folder: Arduino/drivers.

### ***Download the install the library***

[Click](https://github.com/Longan-Labs/Aruino_CAN_BUS_MCP2515/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) to get the Arduino Library for CANBed FD Dev board. 

In the Arduino IDE, navigate to Sketch > Include Library > Add .ZIP Library to install the Library. 


### ***Open the code and upload it to the board***

Open the Arduino IDE, here we open the ***send*** example. This example can continuously send data to the CAN Bus.

```Arduino
#include <mcp_can.h>
#include <SPI.h>

const int SPI_CS_PIN = 17;              // CANBed
// const int SPI_CS_PIN = 3;            // CANBed M0
// const int SPI_CS_PIN = 9;            // CAN Bus Shield

MCP_CAN CAN(SPI_CS_PIN);                                    // Set CS pin

void setup()
{
    Serial.begin(115200);
    while(!Serial);
    
    // below code need for OBD-II GPS Dev Kit
    // pinMode(A3, OUTPUT);
    // digitalWrite(A3, HIGH);
    
    while (CAN_OK != CAN.begin(CAN_500KBPS))    // init can bus : baudrate = 500k
    {
        Serial.println("CAN BUS FAIL!");
        delay(100);
    }
    Serial.println("CAN BUS OK!");
}

unsigned char stmp[8] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7};
void loop()
{
    CAN.sendMsgBuf(0x00, 0, 8, stmp);
    delay(100);                       // send data per 100ms
}

// END FILE
```

You need to select ***Arduino Leonardo*** on the Arduino IDE boards and select the correct COM port. Then you can upload the program to the CANBed FD Dev board by pressing the Upolading button on Arduino IDE.

## ***Get data from a Vehicle***

We can use CANBed to get data from a vehicle, we take the vehicle speed for an example here. 

You can use our products to read data from cars. Here we provide a simple example by which you can read the speed and revs from a car. This is the [OBD-based PIDs protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OBD-II_PIDs). Regarding the deeper technology of OBD, we can't provide support at present. You may need to have some understanding of the car's protocol. After all, we are more of a hardware supplier.

Using CANBed, you can retrieve data from a vehicle. 
For example, you can read the speed and revs of a car using our products and the [OBD-based PIDs protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OBD-II_PIDs). 
While we can provide hardware support, we are unable to offer support for the deeper technology of OBD at this time. 
It is recommended to have some understanding of the car's protocol before attempting to retrieve data.

The interface of OBD is as follows,

![](https://www.longan-labs.cc/media/wysiwyg/CAN-Bus-Case-Dimension/Case-Dimension-07.png)

There're 4 pins we need to connect.

|OBD Pin|CANBed PIN|
|-------|----------|
|5. Signal Ground|GND|
|6. CAN(J-2234) High|CANH|
|14. CAN(J-2234) Low|CANL|
|16. Battery Power|VIN|

You can also use our [OBD-II to DB9 Cable](https://www.longan-labs.cc/2020011.html), which is very convenient to connect to OBD.

To retrieve the speed from a car using the development board, upload the following code and open the serial monitor.

```Arduino

#include <SPI.h>
#include "mcp_can.h"

/* Please modify SPI_CS_PIN to adapt to different baords.

                return 1;
            }

To retrieve other data using PIDs, you can refer to the example provided and to [this link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OBD-II_PIDs).

## ***Arduino Code***

---------------------

We provide an [Arduino library for CANBed](https://github.com/Longan-Labs/CANBed). 

!!!Note
    Please change the SPI_CS_PIN to 17 for CANBed

The library includes several examples, including:

* ***OBDII-PIDs*** -  retrieve data from the OBD-II interface
* ***send*** - send a frame to the CAN bus
* ***recv*** - receive a frame from the CAN bus
* ***set_mask_filter_recv*** - receive a frame from the CAN bus with mask and filter settings

## ***APIs***
--------------------------

### 1. Set the Baud rate

This function is used to initialize the baud rate of the CAN Bus system.

The available baud rates are listed as follows:

	#define CAN_5KBPS    1
	#define CAN_10KBPS   2
	#define CAN_20KBPS   3
	#define CAN_25KBPS   4
	#define CAN_31K25BPS 5
	#define CAN_33KBPS   6
	#define CAN_40KBPS   7
	#define CAN_50KBPS   8
	#define CAN_80KBPS   9
	#define CAN_83K3BPS  10
	#define CAN_95KBPS   11
	#define CAN_100KBPS  12
	#define CAN_125KBPS  13
	#define CAN_200KBPS  14
	#define CAN_250KBPS  15
	#define CAN_500KBPS  16
	#define CAN_666kbps  17
	#define CAN_1000KBPS 18

### 2. Set Receive Mask and Filter

The controller chip has 2 receive mask registers and 5 filter registers that can be used to ensure that data is received from the targeted device. These registers are particularly useful in large networks with many nodes. We have provided two functions that allow you to utilize these mask and filter registers.

**Mask:**

	init_Mask(unsigned char num, unsigned char ext, unsigned char ulData);

**Filter:**

	init_Filt(unsigned char num, unsigned char ext, unsigned char ulData);


- **num** represents which register to use. You can fill 0 or 1 for mask and 0 to 5 for filter.
- **ext** represents the status of the frame. 0 means it's a mask or filter for a standard frame. 1 means it's for a extended frame.
- **ulData** represents the content of the mask of filter.

###3. Check Receive
The MCP2515 controller chip has the ability to operate in either a polled mode or an interrupt mode. In polled mode, the software regularly checks for a received frame. In interrupt mode, additional pins can be used to signal that a frame has been received or transmit has completed. This allows for more efficient use of resources as the processor does not need to constantly check for incoming data.

This function is used to check if there are any received frames waiting in the receive buffer. If there are, the function will return true, otherwise it will return false. You can use this function in a loop to continuously check for received frames. 

    INT8U MCP_CAN::checkReceive(void);

###4. Get CAN ID
You can use the following function to get the length of the data received from the "send" node.

    INT32U MCP_CAN::getCanId(void)

###5. Send a frame

    CAN.sendMsgBuf(INT8U id, INT8U ext, INT8U len, data_buf);

This function is used to send data onto the CAN Bus. The parameters are as follows:

* **id** - The ID of can frame.
* **ext** - A boolean value representing the status of the frame. '0' means standard frame. '1' means extended frame.
* **len** - The length of the frame.
* **data_buf** - The content of the message.

For example, In the 'send' example, we have:

    unsigned char stmp[8] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7};
    CAN.sendMsgBuf(0x00, 0, 8, stmp); //send out the message 'stmp' to the bus and tell other devices this is a standard frame from 0x00.

###6. Receive a frame

The following function is used to receive data on the 'receive' node:

    CAN.readMsgBuf(unsigned char len, unsigned char buf);
    
In conditions that masks and filters have been set. This function can only get frames that meet the requirements of masks and filters.

* **len** represents the data length.
* **buf** is where you store the data.

## ***FAQ***
