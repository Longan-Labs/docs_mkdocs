The Sensor Display board allows you to connect Longan cards with Carduino for read sensor data, and control actuators. If you need more edge connector slots, plug an Extension board into one of the available slots.

## ***What's on***
There are 4 edge connector slots can be found on the front side of the Extension board: (three vertical slots and one horizontal slot).
