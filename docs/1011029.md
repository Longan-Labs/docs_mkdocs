The IR Receiver card allows you to detect infrared (E.g., IR signal from a remote controller). There is an IR detector on the IR Receiver card which is used to get the infrared light emitted by the Infrared Emitter. It can detect a modulated IR signal at 38 KHz. The distance between the IR Receiver card and the IR source should be less than 10 meters.
