CAN Bus is a common industrial bus because of its long travel distance, medium communication speed and high reliability. 
It is commonly found on modern machine tools, such as an automotive diagnostic bus.
CANBed M0 is an upgraded version of [CANBed V1](https://www.longan-labs.cc/1030008.html). CANBed M0 uses an MCU based on the Cortex M0 core and has richer resources than CANBed V1.

### ***DB9 connector***

The DB9 interface of CAN Bus has two different protocols, OBD and CAN Open. Their definition is as follows,

|pin#|OBD(default)|CAN OPEN|
|----|----|-----------|
|1|GND|N.C|
|2|GND|CAN_L|
|3|CANH|GND|
|4|N.C|N.C|
|5|CANL|GND|
|6|N.C|N.C|
|7|N.C|CAN_H|
|8|N.C|N.C|
|9|CAN_V+|CAN_V+|

If you want to use the OBD protocol, you don't need to make any changes to the hardware.

If you need to use the CAN Open protocol, first we look at the back side of the PCB board, you can see the Pads below,

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Longan-Labs/docs_mkdocs/master/docs/images/1030009/CANBED_FD_DB9_SETTING.jpg)

These pads are connected to the OBD side by default. We have to prepare a knife to disconnect the OBD side, and then use an electric soldering iron to solder the CAN Open side of the pads.

## ***USAGE***
--------------------------

### ARDUINO CODE

We provide an [Arduino library for CANBed](https://github.com/Longan-Labs/CANBed). 

!!!Note
    Please change the SPI_CS_PIN to 3 for CANBed M0

There're many examples for the library, which is consist of,

* ***OBDII-PIDs*** - Get data from OBD-II interface
* ***send*** - Send a frame to CAN Bus
* ***recv*** - Receive a frame from CAN Bus
* ***set_mask_filter_recv*** - Receive a frame from CAN Bus with mask and filter setting

## ***APIS***
--------------------------

### 1. SET THE BAUD RATE

This function is used to initialize the baud rate of the CAN Bus system.

The available baud rates are listed as follows:

	#define CAN_5KBPS    1
	#define CAN_10KBPS   2
	#define CAN_20KBPS   3
	#define CAN_25KBPS   4
	#define CAN_31K25BPS 5
	#define CAN_33KBPS   6
	#define CAN_40KBPS   7
	#define CAN_50KBPS   8
	#define CAN_80KBPS   9
	#define CAN_83K3BPS  10
	#define CAN_95KBPS   11
	#define CAN_100KBPS  12
	#define CAN_125KBPS  13
	#define CAN_200KBPS  14
	#define CAN_250KBPS  15
	#define CAN_500KBPS  16
	#define CAN_666kbps  17
	#define CAN_1000KBPS 18

### 2. SET RECEIVE MASK AND FILTER

There are **2** receive mask registers and **5** filter registers on the controller chip that guarantee you getting data from the target device. They are useful especially in a large network  consisting of numerous nodes.

We provide two functions for you to utilize these mask and filter registers. They are:

**Mask:**

	init_Mask(unsigned char num, unsigned char ext, unsigned char ulData);

**Filter:**

	init_Filt(unsigned char num, unsigned char ext, unsigned char ulData);


- **num** represents which register to use. You can fill 0 or 1 for mask and 0 to 5 for filter.
- **ext** represents the status of the frame. 0 means it's a mask or filter for a standard frame. 1 means it's for a extended frame.
- **ulData** represents the content of the mask of filter.

###3. CHECK RECEIVE
The MCP2515 can operate in either a polled mode, where the software checks for a received frame, or using additional pins to signal that a frame has been received or transmit completed.

Use the following function to poll for received frames.

    INT8U MCP_CAN::checkReceive(void);

The function will return 1 if a frame arrives, and 0 if nothing arrives.

###4. GET CAN ID
When some data arrive, you can use the following function to get the CAN ID of the "send" node.

    INT32U MCP_CAN::getCanId(void)

###5. SEND A FRAME

    CAN.sendMsgBuf(INT8U id, INT8U ext, INT8U len, data_buf);

It is a function to send data onto the bus. In which:

* **id** represents where the data comes from.
* **ext** represents the status of the frame. '0' means standard frame. '1' means extended frame.
* **len** represents the length of this frame.
* **data_buf** is the content of this message.

For example, In the 'send' example, we have:

    unsigned char stmp[8] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7};
    CAN.sendMsgBuf(0x00, 0, 8, stmp); //send out the message 'stmp' to the bus and tell other devices this is a standard frame from 0x00.

###6. RECEIVE A FRAME

The following function is used to receive data on the 'receive' node:

    CAN.readMsgBuf(unsigned char len, unsigned char buf);
In conditions that masks and filters have been set. This function can only get frames that meet the requirements of masks and filters.

* **len** represents the data length.
* **buf** is where you store the data.

## ***FAQ***
--------------------------

!!!tip "The RX/TX led light up and never turn off"
    * Check if the baudrate of CAN Bus is setting correct
    * Try turning on/off the switch for the terminal resistor
    * Cehck if CANH and CANL is connected correct
