As the name implies, the Extension board provides additional edge connector slots and allows you to add more Longan cards to your project. 
You can use the Extension board,

* with another Longan board: When your Longan board runs out of free edge connector slots, simply plug an Extension card into one of the available edge connector slot.
* as a stand-alone board: You can use the Extension board to connect any Longan card with the Carduino. If you need more edge connector slots, plug another Extension board into one of the available slots.

## ***What's on***
There are 4 edge connector slots can be found on the front side of the Extension board: (three vertical slots and one horizontal slot).
