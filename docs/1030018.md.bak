CANBed 2040 is a CAN Bus development board based on RP2040, which has **2MB** of Flash and **264KB** of RAM. The operating frequency is up to **133MHz**, which is suitable for most embedded applications.

CANBed 2040 uses **MCP2515** as CAN controller and **MCP2551** as CAN receiver, chich are high-performance CAN Bus chip, work at CAN 2.0 protocols. There is a Micro USB connector on the board, through which you can program the board or supply power to the board. There are one I2C, one UART, one SPI interface, 3 analog input interfaces and 8 digital IO on the board.

We use a flexible way for CAN interface. You can use 4PIN Terminal or DB9 connector. DB9 connector uses OBD-II mode by default. You can also configure CAN Open mode on the hardware. The voltage input range of the CAN interface is 9-28V, which can provide a stable 3.3V/1A output.

If you want to use this board to develop OBD related applications, click to get a [DB9 to OBD-II cable](https://www.longan-labs.cc/2020011.html).

## ***DB9 connector***

The DB9 interface of CAN Bus has two different protocols, OBD and CAN Open. Their definition is as follows,

|pin#|OBD(default)|CAN OPEN|
|----|----|-----------|
|1|GND|N.C|
|2|GND|CAN_L|
|3|CANH|GND|
|4|N.C|N.C|
|5|CANL|GND|
|6|N.C|N.C|
|7|N.C|CAN_H|
|8|N.C|N.C|
|9|CAN_V+|CAN_V+|

If you want to use the OBD protocol, you don't need to make any changes to the hardware.

If you need to use the CAN Open protocol, first we look at the back side of the PCB board, you can see the Pads below,

!!! Note
    The picture shows another board, but it doesn't matter, the operation method is the same.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Longan-Labs/docs_mkdocs/master/docs/images/1030009/CANBED_FD_DB9_SETTING.jpg)

These pads are connected to the OBD side by default. We have to prepare a knife to disconnect the OBD side, and then use an electric soldering iron to solder the CAN Open side of the pads.

*/

MCP_CAN CAN(SPI_CS_PIN);                                    // Set CS pin

void setup()
{
    Serial.begin(115200);
    while(!Serial);
    
    // below code need for OBD-II GPS Dev Kit
    // pinMode(A3, OUTPUT);
    // digitalWrite(A3, HIGH);
    
    while (CAN_OK != CAN.begin(CAN_500KBPS))    // init can bus : baudrate = 500k
    {
        Serial.println("CAN BUS FAIL!");
        delay(100);
    }
    Serial.println("CAN BUS OK!");
}

unsigned char stmp[8] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7};
void loop()
{
    CAN.sendMsgBuf(0x00, 0, 8, stmp);
    delay(100);                       // send data per 100ms
}

// END FILE
```

You need to select ***CANBed 2040*** on the Arduino IDE boards and select the correct COM port. Then you can upload the program to the CANBed 2040 Dev board by pressing the Upolading button on Arduino IDE.


### ***Arduino Code***

---------------------

We provide an [Arduino library for CANBed 2040](https://github.com/Longan-Labs/CANBed). 

!!!Note
    Please change the SPI_CS_PIN to 9 for CANBed 2040

There're many examples for the library, which is consist of,

* ***OBDII-PIDs*** - Get data from OBD-II interface
* ***send*** - Send a frame to CAN Bus
* ***recv*** - Receive a frame from CAN Bus
* ***set_mask_filter_recv*** - Receive a frame from CAN Bus with mask and filter setting

### ***APIs***
--------------------------

#### 1. Set the Baud rate

This function is used to initialize the baud rate of the CAN Bus system.

The available baud rates are listed as follows:

	#define CAN_5KBPS    1
	#define CAN_10KBPS   2
	#define CAN_20KBPS   3
	#define CAN_25KBPS   4
	#define CAN_31K25BPS 5
	#define CAN_33KBPS   6
	#define CAN_40KBPS   7
	#define CAN_50KBPS   8
	#define CAN_80KBPS   9
	#define CAN_83K3BPS  10
	#define CAN_95KBPS   11
	#define CAN_100KBPS  12
	#define CAN_125KBPS  13
	#define CAN_200KBPS  14
	#define CAN_250KBPS  15
	#define CAN_500KBPS  16
	#define CAN_666kbps  17
	#define CAN_1000KBPS 18

#### 2. Set Receive Mask and Filter

There are **2** receive mask registers and **5** filter registers on the controller chip that guarantee you getting data from the target device. They are useful especially in a large network  consisting of numerous nodes.

We provide two functions for you to utilize these mask and filter registers. They are:

**Mask:**

	init_Mask(unsigned char num, unsigned char ext, unsigned char ulData);

**Filter:**

	init_Filt(unsigned char num, unsigned char ext, unsigned char ulData);


- **num** represents which register to use. You can fill 0 or 1 for mask and 0 to 5 for filter.
- **ext** represents the status of the frame. 0 means it's a mask or filter for a standard frame. 1 means it's for a extended frame.
- **ulData** represents the content of the mask of filter.

####3. Check Receive
The MCP2515 can operate in either a polled mode, where the software checks for a received frame, or using additional pins to signal that a frame has been received or transmit completed.

Use the following function to poll for received frames.

    INT8U MCP_CAN::checkReceive(void);

The function will return 1 if a frame arrives, and 0 if nothing arrives.

####4. Get CAN ID
When some data arrive, you can use the following function to get the CAN ID of the "send" node.

    INT32U MCP_CAN::getCanId(void)

####5. Send a frame

    CAN.sendMsgBuf(INT8U id, INT8U ext, INT8U len, data_buf);

It is a function to send data onto the bus. In which:

* **id** ID of can frame.
* **ext** represents the status of the frame. '0' means standard frame. '1' means extended frame.
* **len** represents the length of this frame.
* **data_buf** is the content of this message.

For example, In the 'send' example, we have:

    unsigned char stmp[8] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7};
    CAN.sendMsgBuf(0x00, 0, 8, stmp); //send out the message 'stmp' to the bus and tell other devices this is a standard frame from 0x00.

####6. Receive a frame

The following function is used to receive data on the 'receive' node:

    CAN.readMsgBuf(unsigned char len, unsigned char buf);
In conditions that masks and filters have been set. This function can only get frames that meet the requirements of masks and filters.

* **len** represents the data length.
* **buf** is where you store the data.

## ***Get data from a Vehicle***

We can use CANBed RP2040 to get data from a vehicle, we take the vehicle speed for an example here. 

You can use our products to read data from cars. Here we provide a simple example by which you can read the speed and revs from a car. This is the [OBD-based PIDs protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OBD-II_PIDs). Regarding the deeper technology of OBD, we can't provide support at present. You may need to have some understanding of the car's protocol. After all, we are more of a hardware supplier.


The interface of OBD is as follows,

![](https://www.longan-labs.cc/media/wysiwyg/CAN-Bus-Case-Dimension/Case-Dimension-07.png)

There're 4 pins we need to connect.

|OBD Pin|CANBed PIN|
|-------|----------|
|5. Signal Ground|GND|
|6. CAN(J-2234) High|CANH|
|14. CAN(J-2234) Low|CANL|
|16. Battery Power|VIN|

You can also use our [OBD-II to DB9 Cable](https://www.longan-labs.cc/2020011.html), which is very convenient to connect to OBD.

Upload the following code to the development board, then open the serial monitor, you get the speed from the car now.
