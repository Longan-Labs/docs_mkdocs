## ***Introduction***
--------------------------

[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Longan-Labs/docs_mkdocs/master/docs/images/1030019/main.png)]()

CANBed Dual is a CAN Bus development board with 2 independent CAN Bus interface based on RP2040, there are two independent CAN interfaces on the circuit board, one is CAN2.0 and the other is CAN FD. RP2040 has **2MB** of Flash and **264KB** of RAM. The operating frequency is up to **133MHz**, which is suitable for most embedded applications.

CANBed Dual uses **MCP2515** as CAN 2.0 controller and **MCP2517FD** as CAN FD controller, chich are high-performance CAN Bus chip. There is a Micro USB connector on the board, through which you can program the board or supply power to the board. There are one I2C, one UART, one SPI interface, 3 analog input interfaces and 8 digital IO on the board.

There's a 6PIN Terminal for connecting CAN Bus interface. The voltage input range of the CAN interface is 9-28V, which can provide a stable 5V/1A output.

!!!Note
    For transportation considerations, the plug-in components of the kit are not soldered by default. After you receive the kit, you need to do some soldering work. If necessary, you can also contact info@longan-labs.cc after purchasing the board, then we can send it to you after the board is soldered well.


### ***Application Ideas***

With CANBed Dual, you can，

1. To learn CAN Bus communication
2. To build product prototypes. After you complete the product prototype, we can help you integrate it into a product and assist you in production
3. To read the data from the car
4. As a part of your product, you don't need to design the MCU and CAN Bus separately, only need to complete other hardware design

### ***CANBed Family***

Currently we have 6 CANBeds, you can choose the right one according to your needs.

## ***Getting Started with Arduino IDE***
--------------------------

Here we use the Arduino IDE as a demonstration, through this chapter you can learn how to get started with CANBed Dual.
You need a micro USB cable to connect the CANBed Dual to the computer.

In this demo, CAN FD will send a frame to CAN 2.0 every 100ms.

### ***Arduino IDE Steup***
First download the Arduino IDE from https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software. Arduino IDE can be installed and run on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X operating systems. Download the installer or zip file (Windows only) and install (if you have the zip file, extract it to your Windows computer’s hard drive) it on your operating system.

Once finished, start the Arduino IDE.

Copy and paste the link below into the Additional Boards Manager URLs option in the Arduino IDE preferences (**File > Preferences**).

    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Longan-Labs/Longan-RP2040/main/package_rp2040_index.json

Once done, click OK button to save the new preference settings.

Now open the Boards Manager by navigating to the **Tools -> Board** menu.

Select All from the Type drop-down menu. Then type longan in the top search bar. While typing, you will see the Longan RP2040 Boards package.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Longan-Labs/docs_mkdocs/master/docs/images/1030018/arduino-ide-setup-7.png)

Click on the Longan RP2040 Boards by Longan Labs and then click on Install button.

Once installed, close the Boards Manager window.


### ***Download the install the library***

As there's CAN2.0 as well as CAN FD in the board, we need 2 library here. 

* [Arduino Library for CAN 2.0](https://github.com/Longan-Labs/Aruino_CAN_BUS_MCP2515/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)
* [Arduino Library for CAN FD](https://github.com/Longan-Labs/Longan_CANFD/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)

In the Arduino IDE, navigate to Sketch > Include Library > Add .ZIP Library to install the Library. 

### ***Hardware Connection***

Please conect CANFD-H to CAN20-H, CANFD-L to CAN20-L. 

### ***Open the code and upload it to the board***

Open the Arduino IDE, here we open the ***send*** example. This example can continuously send data to the CAN Bus.

```Arduino
// Demo for CANBed Dual

#include <SPI.h>
#include "mcp2518fd_can.h"
#include "mcp_can.h"

// pins for CANBed FD
const int CS_CANFD = 12;
const int CAN_INT_PIN = 13;

mcp2518fd CANFD(CS_CANFD); // Set CS pin

const int CS_CAN20 = 9;  

MCP_CAN CAN20(CS_CAN20);                                    // Set CS pin

void setup() {
    Serial.begin(115200);
    while(!Serial){};

    while (CAN_OK != CANFD.begin(CANFD_500KBPS)) {             // init can bus : baudrate = 500k
        Serial.println("CAN FD init fail, retry...");
        delay(100);
    }
    Serial.println("CAN FD init ok!");
    
    while (CAN_OK != CAN20.begin(CAN_500KBPS))    // init can bus : baudrate = 500k
    {
        Serial.println("CAN 2.0 init fail, retry...");
        delay(100);
    }
    Serial.println("CAN 2.0 init ok!");
}

unsigned char stmp[8] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7};
unsigned char len = 0;
unsigned char buf[8];

void loop() {

    CANFD.sendMsgBuf(0x01, 0, 8, stmp);                 // can fd send a frame
    
    if(CAN_MSGAVAIL == CAN20.checkReceive())            // check if data coming from can 2.0
    {
        CAN20.readMsgBuf(&len, buf);    // read data,  len: data length, buf: data buf

        unsigned long canId = CAN20.getCanId();
        
        Serial.println("-----------------------------");
        Serial.print("Get data from ID: ");
        Serial.println(canId, HEX);

        for(int i = 0; i<len; i++)    // print the data
        {
            Serial.print(buf[i], HEX);
            Serial.print("\t");
        }
        Serial.println();
    }
    
    delay(100);
}

// END FILE
```

You need to select ***CANBed Dual*** on the Arduino IDE boards and select the correct COM port. Then you can upload the program to the CANBed Dual Dev board by pressing the Upolading button on Arduino IDE.

After the uploading is done, open the Serial monitor, you will see data printed to the monitor.

### ***Arduino Code***

## ***Getting Started with MicroPython***

### What is MicroPython

[MicroPython](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/wiki) is a Python interpreter (with partial native code compilation feature). It provides a subset of Python 3.5 features, implemented for embedded processors and constrained systems. Read more about the differences to CPython [here](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/wiki/Differences).

### How to Use

As the CANBed Dual uses the same chip as the Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040), please to to [Getting Started with Pico](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/pico/getting-started-with-pico.pdf) for details.


## ***FAQ***
--------------------------

!!!tip "I can't upload code to CANBed Dual"
    * When the board is connected to the computer via the Micro USB cable, a new COM device will appear on the computer. If the new device does not appear on your computer, you can try a different USB cable or try another computer.

!!!tip "The RX/TX led light up and never turn off"
    * Check if the baudrate of CAN Bus is setting correct
    * Try turning on/off the switch for the 120Ω terminal resistor
    * Check if CANH and CANL is well connected, H to H and L to L

!!!tip "How to find the tech support"
    Please contact support@longan-labs.cc for technical support. Our technical support engineer will usually reply you within 24 hours on working days. In order to get faster support, we hope that when you send us an email, you need to include at least the following content,
