Longan Core 01 an Arduino UNO compatible board produced by Longan Labs. We will make Longan Core into a series, because this board is the first one, so we named it 01. Longan Core 01 is an ultra-low-cost development board, the price is less than half of the Arduino UNO. In addition, we use the more commonly used Type-C interface, which is more stable. In addition, we also add a button on the Longan Core 01, connected to the D2 pin, users can use this button for some simple interactions, without the need to access another button.


## ***Features***

* Atmega328P microcontroller with Arduino UNO Bootloader

## ***Install Driver***

The CH340 has beed tested on:

* Windows 7/10
* Mac OSX
    * v10.10.5 (Yosemite)
    * v10.11.6 (El Capitan)
    * v10.13.0 (High Sierra)
    * v10.14.5 (Mojave)
* Linux
    * Raspbian Stretch (11-13-2018 release) for the Raspberry Pi
    * Raspbian Buster (2019-07-10 release) for the Raspberry Pi
    * Ubuntu v18.04.2, 64-bit
    
These operating systems have the CDC drivers pre-installed, which means you shouldn't need to install any extra software. However, there are a wide range of operating systems out there, so if you run into driver problems, you can get the archived drivers linked below:
