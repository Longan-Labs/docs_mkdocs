We launched the Serial CAN Bus Module years ago, which is very practial and easy to use. 
Now we have slightly modified the Serial CAN Bus Module, wrote a special firmware, and launched this I2C CAN Bus Module.

The I2C CAN Bus Module uses I2C for communication. The board is small and flexible, which make it can be quickly used in any system with an I2C interface.

The I2C CAN Bus Module is based on the high-performance MCP2515 CAN Bus controller and MCP2551 CAN Bus transceiver, provides a CAN Bus communication rate of up to 1Mb/s.

In addition, there is an Atmega168PA microcontroller on the board, you can also program it through a USB to Serial board, modify the firmware or write your application directly. 

!!!Note
    The default masks and filters is for standard can frame, if you need to receive a ext can frame, please set the mask and filt first.

## ***Work with Arduino***
---------------------

### 120Ω Terminal Resistor

As there're only 2 serial can bus device, it need the 120Ω resistor, there's a P1 on the back side, please solder P1 to get the 120Ω resistor, as shown below,

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Longan-Labs/Longan_Site_Images/master/SerialCAN/120ohm.jpg)

!!!Note
    The picture shows the Serial CAN Bus Module, but it is also applicable to the I2C CAN Bus Module
    
### Hardware Connection

There are 4 pins on the board, they are:

|Pin Name|Function|Color|
|--------|--------|-----|
|SCL|SCL of I2C|Yellow|
|SDA|SDA of I2C|White|
|VCC|3.3 or 5V|Red|
|GND|Ground|Black|

If you got a [Base Shield](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Base-Shield-V2.html) from Seeedstudio, the connection is easy, like below,

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Longan-Labs/Longan_Site_Images/master/SerialCAN/3.jpg)

If there's no Base Shield for you, you need some dupont cable, and connect SCL/SDA to the IO of your Arduino, here we connect SCL/SDA to A5/A4:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Longan-Labs/Longan_Site_Images/master/SerialCAN/2.jpg)


### Software

We provide an Arduino Library for the board. 

Please download it at [Github](https://github.com/Longan-Labs/I2C_CAN_Arduino)

There're many examples for the library, which is consist of,

* ***send*** - How to send a frame to CAN Bus
* ***recv*** - How to recv a frame from CAN Bus
* ***debug*** - debug mode, you can send a cmd to the module
* ***set_can_baudrate*** - set can bus baudrate
* ***set_mask_filt*** - set mask and filt of the module


### Test the board

Here we make an example to show you how the board work with CAN Bus. 

The connection like below, here we use Longan Core 01 + I2C CAN bus module as a receiver, and a CANBed V1 as CAN Bus sender.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Longan-Labs/Longan_Site_Images/master/SerialCAN/1.jpg)

Upload the recv example to Longan Core 01, and send example to CANBed. 

Open Serial monitor of Longan Core 01, you will get the can frame from CAN Bus.


## ***Working Standalone***
-----------

For V1.2 and after, you can program the  on-board MCU (Atmega168PA) with Arduino IDE.

First, you need a USB to Serial board, something like the [Programmer Card](https://www.longan-labs.cc/1016006.html)

Here we will take Programmer Card as an example:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Longan-Labs/docs_mkdocs/master/docs/images/canbus/serial_can_program.png)

Then, we need to setup your Arduino IDE. 

Start the Arduino IDE.

Copy and paste the link below into the **Additional Boards** Manager URLs option in the **Arduino IDE preferences** (**File > Preferences**).

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Longan-Labs/docs_mkdocs/master/docs/images/1013001/preferences.png)


https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Longan-Labs/Longan-Board/master/package_longan_boards_index.json

The Longan AVR boards supplied package includes supports for Longan Card, Carduino 328, Carduino 32U4.

Once done, click **OK** button to save the new preference settings.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Longan-Labs/docs_mkdocs/master/docs/images/1013001/arduino-ide-setup-5.png)

Now open the Boards Manager by navigating to the **Tools -> Board** menu.

Select **All** from the Type drop-down menu. Then type **longan** in the top search bar. While typing, you will see the **Longan AVR package**.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Longan-Labs/docs_mkdocs/master/docs/images/1013001/arduino-ide-setup-7.png)

Click on the **Longan AVR by Longan Labs** and then click on **Install** button.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Longan-Labs/docs_mkdocs/master/docs/images/1013001/arduino-ide-setup-8.png)

Once installed, close the **Boards Manager** window.

Then you can find ***Serial CAN Bus Module*** in the board list.

## ***FAQ***

!!!tip "The RX and TX leds light up instead of blinking"
    * Please check the baudrate of CAN Bus
    * If the serial can bus module is in the end, the 120Ω terminal resistor is needed, please soder P1 on the back side of PCBA

!!!tip "How to find the tech support"
    Please feel free to contact joney.sui@longan-labs.cc if you need more help.
