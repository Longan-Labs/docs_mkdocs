## ***Introduction***
------------

[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Longan-Labs/Longan_Site_Images/master/SerialCAN/CAN-4.jpg)](https://www.longan-labs.cc/1030001.html)

We launched the [Serial CAN Bus Module](https://www.longan-labs.cc/1030001.html) years ago, which is very practial and easy to use. 
Now we have slightly modified the Serial CAN Bus Module, wrote a special firmware, and launched this I2C CAN Bus Module.

The I2C CAN Bus Module uses I2C for communication. The board is small and flexible, which make it can be quickly used in any system with an I2C interface.

The I2C CAN Bus Module is based on the high-performance MCP2515 CAN Bus controller and MCP2551 CAN Bus transceiver, provides a CAN Bus communication rate of up to 1Mb/s.

In addition, there is an Atmega168PA microcontroller on the board, you can also program it through a USB to Serial board, modify the firmware or write your application directly. 

!!!Note
    The default masks and filters is for standard can frame, if you need to receive a ext can frame, please set the mask and filt first.

### Hardware Connection

There are 4 pins on the board, they are:

|Pin Name|Function|Color|
|--------|--------|-----|
|SCL|SCL of I2C|Yellow|
|SDA|SDA of I2C|White|
|VCC|3.3 or 5V|Red|
|GND|Ground|Black|

If you got a [Base Shield](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Base-Shield-V2.html) from Seeedstudio, the connection is easy, like below,

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Longan-Labs/docs_mkdocs/master/docs/images/1030017/connection1.jpg)

If there's no Base Shield for you, you need some dupont cable, and connect SCL/SDA to the IO of your Arduino, here we connect SCL/SDA to A5/A4:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Longan-Labs/docs_mkdocs/master/docs/images/1030017/connection2.jpg)


### Software

We provide an Arduino Library for the board. 

Please download it at [Github](https://github.com/Longan-Labs/I2C_CAN_Arduino)

There're many examples for the library, which is consist of,

* ***send*** - How to send a frame to CAN Bus
* ***recv*** - How to recv a frame from CAN Bus
* ***debug*** - debug mode, you can send a cmd to the module
* ***set_can_baudrate*** - set can bus baudrate
* ***set_mask_filt*** - set mask and filt of the module


### Test the board

Here we make an example to show you how the board work with CAN Bus. 

The connection like below, here we use [Longan Core 01](https://www.longan-labs.cc/1040009.html) + I2C CAN bus module as a receiver, and a [CANBed V1](https://www.longan-labs.cc/1030008.html) as CAN Bus sender.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Longan-Labs/docs_mkdocs/master/docs/images/1030017/connection3.jpg)

Upload the [recv example](https://github.com/Longan-Labs/I2C_CAN_Arduino/blob/main/examples/recv/recv.ino) to Longan Core 01

#include <Wire.h>

#include "Longan_I2C_CAN_Arduino.h"


I2C_CAN CAN(0x25);                                    // Set I2C Address

void setup()
{
    Serial.begin(115200);
    //while(!Serial);
    
    Serial.println("begin to init can");
    
    while (CAN_OK != CAN.begin(CAN_500KBPS))    // init can bus : baudrate = 500k
    {
        Serial.println("CAN BUS FAIL!");
        delay(100);
    }
    Serial.println("CAN BUS OK!");
    pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
}


void loop()
{
    unsigned char len = 0;
    unsigned char buf[8];

    if(CAN_MSGAVAIL == CAN.checkReceive())            // check if data coming
    {
        CAN.readMsgBuf(&len, buf);    // read data,  len: data length, buf: data buf

        if(len)
        {
            unsigned long canId = CAN.getCanId();

            Serial.print("Get ID: ");
            Serial.println(canId, HEX);

            }
            Serial.println();
        }
    }
    
    delay(10);
    blink();
}

void blink()
{
    static unsigned long timer_s = millis();
    if(millis()-timer_s < 100)return;
    timer_s = millis();
    digitalWrite(13, 1-digitalRead(13));
}
// END FILE
```

Then, upload [send example](https://github.com/Longan-Labs/Aruino_CAN_BUS_MCP2515/tree/master/examples/send) to CANBed. 

Open Serial monitor of Longan Core 01, you will get the can frame from CAN Bus.

## ***Get data from a Vehicle***

We can use this module to get data from a vehicle, we take the vehicle speed for an example here. 

You can use our products to read data from cars. Here we provide a simple example by which you can read the speed and revs from a car. This is the [OBD-based PIDs protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OBD-II_PIDs). Regarding the deeper technology of OBD, we can't provide support at present. You may need to have some understanding of the car's protocol. After all, we are more of a hardware supplier.


The interface of OBD is as follows,

![](https://www.longan-labs.cc/media/wysiwyg/CAN-Bus-Case-Dimension/Case-Dimension-07.png)

There're 4 pins we need to connect.

|OBD Pin|I2C CAN|
|-------|----------|
|6. CAN(J-2234) High|CANH|
|14. CAN(J-2234) Low|CANL|

You can also use our [OBD Connector](https://www.longan-labs.cc/can-bus/accessory.html), which is very convenient to connect to OBD.

Upload the following code to the development board, then open the serial monitor, you get the speed from the car now.


```Arduino
#include <Wire.h>
#include "Longan_I2C_CAN_Arduino.h"

I2C_CAN CAN(0x25);                                    // Set I2C Address

#define PID_ENGIN_PRM       0x0C
#define PID_VEHICLE_SPEED   0x0D
#define PID_COOLANT_TEMP    0x05

#define CAN_ID_PID          0x7DF

void set_mask_filt()
{
    // set mask, set both the mask to 0x3ff

    CAN.init_Mask(0, 0, 0x7FC);
    CAN.init_Mask(1, 0, 0x7FC);

    // set filter, we can receive id from 0x04 ~ 0x09

    CAN.init_Filt(0, 0, 0x7E8);                 
    CAN.init_Filt(1, 0, 0x7E8);

    CAN.init_Filt(2, 0, 0x7E8);
    CAN.init_Filt(3, 0, 0x7E8);
    CAN.init_Filt(4, 0, 0x7E8); 
    CAN.init_Filt(5, 0, 0x7E8);
}

void sendPid(unsigned char __pid) {
    unsigned char tmp[8] = {0x02, 0x01, __pid, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0};
    CAN.sendMsgBuf(CAN_ID_PID, 0, 8, tmp);
}

bool getSpeed(int *s)
{
    sendPid(PID_VEHICLE_SPEED);
    unsigned long __timeout = millis();

    while(millis()-__timeout < 1000)      // 1s time out
    {
        unsigned char len = 0;
        unsigned char buf[8];

        if (CAN_MSGAVAIL == CAN.checkReceive()) {                // check if get data
            CAN.readMsgBuf(&len, buf);    // read data,  len: data length, buf: data buf

            if(buf[1] == 0x41)
            {
                *s = buf[3];
                return 1;
            }
        }
    }

    return 0;
}

void setup() {
    Serial.begin(115200);
    while(!Serial);
    
    while (CAN_OK != CAN.begin(CAN_500KBPS)) {             // init can bus : baudrate = 500k
        Serial.println("CAN init fail, retry...");
        delay(100);
    }
    Serial.println("CAN init ok!");
    set_mask_filt();
}

void loop() {

    int __speed = 0;
    int ret = getSpeed(&__speed);
    if(ret)
    {
        Serial.print("Vehicle Speed: ");
        Serial.print(__speed);
        Serial.println(" kmh");
    }
    delay(500);
}

// END FILE
```
If you want to get other data by PIDs, you can refer to the above example, and refer to [this link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OBD-II_PIDs)


## ***Working Standalone***
-----------

You can program the on-board MCU (Atmega168PA) with Arduino IDE.

First, you need a USB to Serial board, something like the [Programmer Card](https://www.longan-labs.cc/1016006.html)

Here we will take Programmer Card as an example,

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Longan-Labs/docs_mkdocs/master/docs/images/canbus/serial_can_program.png)

!!!Note
    The picture shows the Serial CAN Bus Module, but it is also applicable to this I2C CAN Bus Module
    
Then, we need to setup your Arduino IDE. 

Start the Arduino IDE.

Copy and paste the link below into the **Additional Boards** Manager URLs option in the **Arduino IDE preferences** (**File > Preferences**).

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Longan-Labs/docs_mkdocs/master/docs/images/1013001/preferences.png)


https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Longan-Labs/Longan-Board/master/package_longan_boards_index.json

The Longan AVR boards supplied package includes supports for Longan Card, Carduino 328, Carduino 32U4.

Once done, click **OK** button to save the new preference settings.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Longan-Labs/docs_mkdocs/master/docs/images/1013001/arduino-ide-setup-5.png)

Now open the Boards Manager by navigating to the **Tools -> Board** menu.

Select **All** from the Type drop-down menu. Then type **longan** in the top search bar. While typing, you will see the **Longan AVR package**.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Longan-Labs/docs_mkdocs/master/docs/images/1013001/arduino-ide-setup-7.png)

Click on the **Longan AVR by Longan Labs** and then click on **Install** button.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Longan-Labs/docs_mkdocs/master/docs/images/1013001/arduino-ide-setup-8.png)

Once installed, close the **Boards Manager** window.

Then you can find ***Serial CAN Bus Module*** in the board list.

## ***Update the Firmware***

First we need to read the content of the [previous chapter](http://docs.longan-labs.cc/1030017/#working-standalone).

1. Download the Firmware for [I2C CAN Bus Module](https://github.com/Longan-Labs/I2C_CAN_Firmware)
2. You may need this [CAN Bus library](https://github.com/Longan-Labs/Aruino_CAN_BUS_MCP2515)
3. Upload the Firmware to I2C CAN Bus module, then it work. 


## ***FAQ***

!!!tip "The RX and TX leds light up instead of blinking"
