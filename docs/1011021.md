9-Dof Sensor Card is a high performance 9-axis motion tracking card from Longan Labs, which is based on MPU-9250. The MPU-9250 provides,

* 3-Axis gyroscope
* 3-Axis accelerometer
* 3-Axis magnetometer

Hence, the MPU-9250 is a 9-axis Motion Tracking device that combines a 3-axis gyroscope, 3-axis accelerometer, 3-axis magnetometer and a Digital Motion Processor™ (DMP).

## ***Features***
* Gyroscope Features
** Digital-output X-, Y-, and Z-Axis angular rate sensors (gyroscopes) with a user-programmable fullscale range of ±250, ±500, ±1000, and ±2000°/sec and integrated 16-bit ADCs

* Accelerometer Features
** Digital-output triple-axis accelerometer with a programmable full scale range of ±2g, ±4g, ±8g and
±16g and integrated 16-bit ADCs

* Magnetometer Features
** 3-axis silicon monolithic Hall-effect magnetic sensor with magnetic concentrator
