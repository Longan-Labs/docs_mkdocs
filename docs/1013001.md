## ***How to Use***
Carduino 328 can be plugged in to one of the edge connector slots available in the following boards.

* Game board
* Car board
* Sensor display board
* Extension board
* Pi Hap

All Longan cards are polarized, and every pin is unique in terms of both location and function. On the front side of the Carduino, a white arrow is printed near the edge connector indicates the pin #1.

### ***Using with Extension Board***
We will be using Longan Extension board demonstrate how you can insert the Carduino 328 in to an edge connector slot.

Take the Carduino 328, programmer card, and Extension board. 

Plug the Carduino 328 into one of the edge connector slots of the Extension board.

Also, plug the Programmer card into another edge connector slot of the Extension board.

Connect the Type-C USB cable to the USB connector of the Programmer card and connect the other end to your computer.

### ***Blink***
We will start off with something very simple with an LED, turning on and off, repeatedly, producing a pleasant blinking effect. The Carduino 328 has a built-in LED on digital pin 13 (Arduino UNO equivalent) emits bright blue light when turned on. You can find it on the front of the Carduino 328.

Now you can upload your first Blink sketch to the Carduino 328. The Arduino IDE provides a great example for blinking a LED. There is no need to type anything, just click **File > Example > 01.Basics > Blink** under **Built-in Examples** in the Arduino IDE.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Longan-Labs/docs_mkdocs/master/docs/images/1013001/arduino-ide-setup-1.png)

Next, tell the Arduino IDE to use the Carduino. To do this, click **Tools > Board > Arduino/Genuino UNOi** under **Longen AVR Boards**.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Longan-Labs/docs_mkdocs/master/docs/images/1013001/arduino-ide-setup-2.png)

Then select the proper port in **Tools > Port > (the Serial/COM port of your Carduino 238)**.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Longan-Labs/docs_mkdocs/master/docs/images/1013001/arduino-ide-setup-3.png)

Next, upload the program by clicking **Sketch > Upload**.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Longan-Labs/docs_mkdocs/master/docs/images/1013001/arduino-ide-setup-4.png)

It will take some time to compile and upload the sketch in to the Carduino.

If you have trouble loading the Blink sketch from the examples, you can copy and paste the code below into the Arduino editor.

/*
  Blink

  Turns an LED on for one second, then off for one second, repeatedly.

  Most Arduinos have an on-board LED you can control. On the UNO, MEGA and ZERO
  it is attached to digital pin 13, on MKR1000 on pin 6. LED_BUILTIN is set to
  the correct LED pin independent of which board is used.
  If you want to know what pin the on-board LED is connected to on your Arduino
  model, check the Technical Specs of your board at:

*/

// the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
void setup() {
  // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output.
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop function runs repeatedly forever
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);   // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(1000);                       // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);    // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(1000);                       // wait for a second
}
~~~

After uploading the sketch to the Carduino 328, you should see the LED on the card is blinking.
