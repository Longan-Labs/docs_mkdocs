**A badge with interactive lightning and music**

## ***Introduction***

For KeyBoard, we just want to make PCB a fine look and more interesting. It is an interactive badge with touching, lightning, and melody. You can wear it on your neck or fix it to your bag. Press the lightning icon to switch between two modes. One is a mini piano while another is circular melody and chasing light. Enjoy a wonderful night at music live with KeyBoard!
