## ***INTRODUCTION***
--------------------------

[![](https://www.longan-labs.cc/media/catalog/product/cache/ecd051e9670bd57df35c8f0b122d8aea/1/0/1030014-3_1.jpg)]()

Usually there is an OBD-II interface on the vehicla, allowing the user to read some data through the CAN-Bus interface, such as vehicle speed, engin speed, oil temperature, etc. We have also made some OBD-II related products, such as OBD-II CAN-Bus GPS Dev Kit, which can store the data read through OBD-II to SD card.

During the use of OBD, an OBD-II cable is usually required to connect to the vehicle. Wiring is a simple matter, but it is not so easy to hide the cable. For this we designed this OBD-II RF Dev Kit. 

This kit contains two parts, which we call the transmitter and receiver. The transmitter is inserted into the OBD-II interface of the vehicle, and the transmitter is integrated with CAN-Bus interface and RF communication, which can transmit the data read by CAN-Bus to the remote end through RF. The receiver is a Serial RF Module, which can send the data from the receiving end to the microcontroller through the serial port.

If you want to use OBD-II for some interesting projects, you can try this kit, you will not be disappointed.

## ***AT Command***
-----------------------------

You can achieve the complete function of this kit with only a few AT command.

!!!Note
    The AT Command here is the same as the AT command of the Serial CAN Bus Module. If you have used the Serial CAN Bus Module, you will be familiar with these commands.
    
|CMD|Description|
|---|-----------|
|+++|Switch from Normal mode to Config mode|
|AT+C=[value]|Set CAN Bus baud rate|
|AT+M=[N][EXT][value]|Set mask|
|AT+F=[N][EXT][value]|Set filter|
|AT+Q|Switch to Normal Mode|

!!! tip "Tips"
    All of the cmd should end with '\n' except +++

### Set CAN Bus Baudrate
--------------------

You can use this command to set the rate of CAN Bus, there's 18 rates available. 
Normally, if you want to hack your vehicle, 500k is the right one. 

```
AT+C=[value]
```

|value|01|02|03|04|05|06|07|08|09|10|11|12|13|14|15|16|17|18|
|-----|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
|rate(kb/s)|5|10|20|25|31.2|33|40|50|80|83.3|95|100|125|200|250|**500**|666|1000|

!!! tip
    For most vehicles, the baud rate of CANBus is 500kb/s, and a few cars are 1Mb/s

**Eg:** Set CAN BUS baud rate to 50K
```
AT+C=08
```

**Respose**

OK or ERROR

### Set Mask

## ***Working Mode***
-----------

When the module working on Working mode (default mode), you can send and recevie data from CAN Bus. 

### Send

You should send 14 byte of data per frame. Defined as below,

|bit|0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|10|11|12|13|
|---|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|--|--|--|--|
|define |ID3|ID2|ID1|ID0|EXT|RTR|DTA0|DTA1|DTA2|DTA3|DTA4|DTA5|DTA6|DTA7|

* ID0~ID3: CAN ID
* EXT: 0 for standard frame, 1 for extended frame
* RTR: 0 for standard frame, 1 for remote frame
* DTA0~DTA7: 8 byte of data

**Eg.**

Send {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8} to ID:0x3DC, Standard frame:
```c
{0, 0, 3, 0xDC, 0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
```

### Recv

You will get 12 byte of data per frame. Defined as below,

|bit|0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|10|11|
|---|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|--|--|
|define |ID3|ID2|ID1|ID0|DTA0|DTA1|DTA2|DTA3|DTA4|DTA5|DTA6|DTA7|

* ID0~ID3: CAN ID
* DTA0~DTA7: 8 byte of data



## ***USAGE***
--------------------------

### ARDUINO CODE

We provide an [Arduino library for CANBed](https://github.com/Longan-Labs/CANBed). 

There're many examples for the library, which is consist of,

* ***OBDII-PIDs*** - Get data from OBD-II interface
* ***send*** - Send a frame to CAN Bus
* ***recv*** - Receive a frame from CAN Bus
* ***set_mask_filter_recv*** - Receive a frame from CAN Bus with mask and filter setting

## ***APIS***
--------------------------

### 1. SET THE BAUD RATE

This function is used to initialize the baud rate of the CAN Bus system.

The available baud rates are listed as follows:

	#define CAN_5KBPS    1
	#define CAN_10KBPS   2
	#define CAN_20KBPS   3
	#define CAN_25KBPS   4
	#define CAN_31K25BPS 5
	#define CAN_33KBPS   6
	#define CAN_40KBPS   7
	#define CAN_50KBPS   8
	#define CAN_80KBPS   9
	#define CAN_83K3BPS  10
	#define CAN_95KBPS   11
	#define CAN_100KBPS  12
	#define CAN_125KBPS  13
	#define CAN_200KBPS  14
	#define CAN_250KBPS  15
	#define CAN_500KBPS  16
	#define CAN_666kbps  17
	#define CAN_1000KBPS 18

### 2. SET RECEIVE MASK AND FILTER

There are **2** receive mask registers and **5** filter registers on the controller chip that guarantee you getting data from the target device. They are useful especially in a large network  consisting of numerous nodes.

We provide two functions for you to utilize these mask and filter registers. They are:

**Mask:**

	init_Mask(unsigned char num, unsigned char ext, unsigned char ulData);

**Filter:**

	init_Filt(unsigned char num, unsigned char ext, unsigned char ulData);


- **num** represents which register to use. You can fill 0 or 1 for mask and 0 to 5 for filter.
- **ext** represents the status of the frame. 0 means it's a mask or filter for a standard frame. 1 means it's for a extended frame.
- **ulData** represents the content of the mask of filter.

###3. CHECK RECEIVE
The MCP2515 can operate in either a polled mode, where the software checks for a received frame, or using additional pins to signal that a frame has been received or transmit completed.

Use the following function to poll for received frames.

    INT8U MCP_CAN::checkReceive(void);

The function will return 1 if a frame arrives, and 0 if nothing arrives.

###4. GET CAN ID
When some data arrive, you can use the following function to get the CAN ID of the "send" node.

    INT32U MCP_CAN::getCanId(void)

###5. SEND A FRAME

    CAN.sendMsgBuf(INT8U id, INT8U ext, INT8U len, data_buf);

It is a function to send data onto the bus. In which:

* **id** represents where the data comes from.
* **ext** represents the status of the frame. '0' means standard frame. '1' means extended frame.
* **len** represents the length of this frame.
* **data_buf** is the content of this message.

For example, In the 'send' example, we have:

    unsigned char stmp[8] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7};
    CAN.sendMsgBuf(0x00, 0, 8, stmp); //send out the message 'stmp' to the bus and tell other devices this is a standard frame from 0x00.

###6. RECEIVE A FRAME

The following function is used to receive data on the 'receive' node:

    CAN.readMsgBuf(unsigned char len, unsigned char buf);
In conditions that masks and filters have been set. This function can only get frames that meet the requirements of masks and filters.

* **len** represents the data length.
* **buf** is where you store the data.

## ***HOW TO GET DATA FROM VEHICLE***
---------------

Here we provide an example of reading data from a vihicle. In order to simplify the process, we only read the speed and engin speed of the vehicle.

In addition to OBD-II RF Dev Kit, we also need some other modules to complete this application, we need to use the following modules:

* [Longan Core 01](https://www.longan-labs.cc/1040009.html): An Arduino UNO compatible board, priced at only $5.9
* [AAA Battery Shield](https://www.longan-labs.cc/1040007.html): This shiel use two AAA batteries to provide a stable 5V for Arduino
* [I2C_LCD](https://www.seeedstudio.com/I2C-LCD-With-universal-Grove-cable.html): A simple and easy-to-use display that communicates via I2C

### Hardware Connection

First, we insert the AAA Battery Shield to Longan Core 01, then insert the I2C_LCD into the I2C port on the AAA Battery Shield, and insert the Serial RF module in the OBD-II RF Dev Kit into the A0 port.

As shown below:

### Upload the code

We procide an Arduino library for the kit, you have to install the library first. 
Then, download the code for the demo, and upload it to Longan Core 01.

If nothing unexpected happens, there's should be values of speed and engin speed displaied on the LCD, as shown below:
