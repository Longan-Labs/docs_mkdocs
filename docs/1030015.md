## ***INTRODUCTION***
--------------------------

[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Longan-Labs/docs_mkdocs/master/docs/images/1030015/main.jpg)]()

Usually there is an OBD-II interface on the vehicla, allowing the user to read some data through the CAN-Bus interface, such as vehicle speed, engin speed, oil temperature, etc. We have also made some OBD-II related products, such as OBD-II CAN-Bus GPS Dev Kit, which is able to store the data read through OBD-II to SD card.

During the use of OBD, an OBD-II cable is usually required to connect to the vehicle. Wiring is easy, but hiding the cable is hard. For this reason we designed this OBD-II RF Dev Kit. 

This kit contains two parts, which we call the transmitter and receiver. The transmitter is inserted into the OBD-II interface of the vehicle, and the transmitter is integrated with CAN-Bus interface and RF communication, which can transmit the data read by CAN-Bus to the remote end through RF. The receiver is a Serial RF Module, which can send the data from the receiving end to the microcontroller through the serial port.

If you want to use OBD-II for some interesting projects, you can try this kit, you will not be disappointed.

## ***USAGE***
--------------------------

### ARDUINO CODE

We provide an [Arduino library for OBD-II RF Dev Kit](https://github.com/Longan-Labs/OBD_II_RF_Dev_Kit_Library). 

There're many examples for the library, which is consist of,

* ***OBDII-PIDs*** - Get data from OBD-II interface
* ***send*** - Send a frame to CAN Bus
* ***recv*** - Receive a frame from CAN Bus
* ***set_mask_filter_recv*** - Receive a frame from CAN Bus with mask and filter setting

## ***HOW TO GET DATA FROM VEHICLE***
---------------

Here we provide an example of reading data from a vihicle. In order to simplify the process, we only read the speed and engin speed of the vehicle.

In addition to OBD-II RF Dev Kit, we also need some other modules to complete this application, we need to use the following modules:

* [Longan Core 01](https://www.longan-labs.cc/1040009.html): An Arduino UNO compatible board, priced at only $5.9
* [AAA Battery Shield](https://www.longan-labs.cc/1040007.html): This shiel use two AAA batteries to provide a stable 5V for Arduino
* [I2C_LCD](https://www.longan-labs.cc/1040011.html): A simple and easy-to-use display that communicates via I2C

### Hardware Connection

First, we insert the AAA Battery Shield to Longan Core 01, then insert the I2C_LCD into the I2C port on the AAA Battery Shield, and insert the Serial RF module in the OBD-II RF Dev Kit into the A0 port.

As shown below:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Longan-Labs/docs_mkdocs/master/docs/images/1030015/connect1.jpg)

As for the transmitter, plug it into the OBD-II interface of your vehicle, as shown below:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Longan-Labs/docs_mkdocs/master/docs/images/1030015/connect2car.jpg)

### Upload the code

We procide an [Arduino library for OBD-II RF Dev kit](https://github.com/Longan-Labs/OBD_II_RF_Dev_Kit_Library), you have to install the library first. 
You have to install the [Library for I2C_LCD](https://github.com/SparkingStudio/I2C_LCD/raw/master/resources/I2C_LCD_Library.zip) as well.
Then, download the [code for the demo](https://github.com/Longan-Labs/OBD_II_RF_Dev_Kit_Library/blob/main/examples/obd_demo2/obd_demo2.ino), and upload it to Longan Core 01.

If nothing unexpected happens, there's should be values of speed and engin speed displaied on the LCD, as shown below:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Longan-Labs/docs_mkdocs/master/docs/images/1030015/result1.jpg)


If you want to read other parameters, you can refer to [OBD-II_PIDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OBD-II_PIDs)

## ***AT Command***
-----------------------------

We can use AT commands to set up and control the transmitter. When using AT commands, we need to connect the transmitter to power, otherwise the command will not be received.


!!!Note
    The AT Command here is the same as the AT command of the Serial CAN Bus Module. If you have used the Serial CAN Bus Module, you will be familiar with these commands.
    
|CMD|Description|
|---|-----------|
|+++|Switch from Normal mode to Config mode|
|AT+C=[value]|Set CAN Bus baud rate|
|AT+M=[N][EXT][value]|Set mask|
|AT+F=[N][EXT][value]|Set filter|
|AT+Q|Switch to Normal Mode|

!!! tip "Tips"
    All of the cmd should end with '\n' except +++

### Set CAN Bus Baudrate
--------------------

You can use this command to set the rate of CAN Bus, there's 18 rates available. 
Normally, if you want to hack your vehicle, 500k is the right one. 

```
AT+C=[value]
```

|value|01|02|03|04|05|06|07|08|09|10|11|12|13|14|15|16|17|18|
|-----|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
|rate(kb/s)|5|10|20|25|31.2|33|40|50|80|83.3|95|100|125|200|250|**500**|666|1000|

!!! tip
    For most vehicles, the baud rate of CANBus is 500kb/s, and a few cars are 1Mb/s

**Eg:** Set CAN BUS baud rate to 50K
```
AT+C=08
```

**Respose**

OK or ERROR

### Set Mask
---------------
There're 2 Mask for the module, Mask0 and Mask1.

```
AT+M=[N][EXT][value]
```

**N:**

* 0: Mask0
* 1: Mask1

**EXT:**

* 0: Standard Frame
* 1: Extended Frame

**value:**

Neeed 8 bit of character, hexadecimal.

**Eg:** Set Mask1 to 0x3DF, standard frame:
```
AT+M=[1][0][000003DF]
```

**Respose**

OK or ERROR

### Set Filt
-------------------

There're 6 Mask for the module, Filt0 ~ Filt5

```
AT+F=[N][EXT][value]
```

**N:**

| N | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Filt|Filt0|Filt1|Filt2|Filt3|Filt4|Filt5|


**EXT:**

* 0: Standard Frame
* 1: Extended Frame

**value:**

Neeed 8 bit of character, hexadecimal.


**Eg:** Set Filt3 to 0x2C, standard frame:
```
AT+F=[1][0][0000002C]
```

**Respose**

OK or ERROR


## ***Working Mode***
-----------

When the module working on Working mode (default mode), you can send and recevie data from CAN Bus. 

### Send

You should send 14 byte of data per frame. Defined as below,

|bit|0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|10|11|12|13|
|---|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|--|--|--|--|
|define |ID3|ID2|ID1|ID0|EXT|RTR|DTA0|DTA1|DTA2|DTA3|DTA4|DTA5|DTA6|DTA7|

* ID0~ID3: CAN ID
* EXT: 0 for standard frame, 1 for extended frame
* RTR: 0 for standard frame, 1 for remote frame
* DTA0~DTA7: 8 byte of data

**Eg.**

Send {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8} to ID:0x3DC, Standard frame:
```c
{0, 0, 3, 0xDC, 0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
```

### Recv

You will get 12 byte of data per frame. Defined as below,

|bit|0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|10|11|
|---|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|--|--|
|define |ID3|ID2|ID1|ID0|DTA0|DTA1|DTA2|DTA3|DTA4|DTA5|DTA6|DTA7|

* ID0~ID3: CAN ID
* DTA0~DTA7: 8 byte of data
