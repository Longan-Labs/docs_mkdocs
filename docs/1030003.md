The OBD Ⅱ Slaver allows you to hack your vehicle with the integrated OBD port and output all the data via serial interface. It supports the CAN bus protocol, integrates micro SD card slot. On top of that, with the help of a build-in Atmega32U4, it's compatible with arduino. Which means you can code it like a ardunio, then just plug it into your car's OBD port, you will get the output data via the Type C USB port or you can store all the data into your micro-SD card (TF card), easy-peasy.

This Serial CAN Bus module is based on **MCP2551** and **MCP2515**, which can provide can baud rate from **5kb/s** to **1Mb/s**. 

One more thing, we integrate the GPS module, you can even track your car with this fantastic little module. It is obviously that you will love it, happy hacking！

###　Pin out


***Base Board***

![](https://github.com/Longan-Labs/OBD-II_Slaver_GPS_kit/raw/master/allpin.png)

**1.OBD-II Connector:** 

On-board diagnostics (OBD) is an automotive term referring to a vehicle's self-diagnostic and reporting capability. OBD-II is an improvement over OBD-I in both capability and standardization. The OBD-II standard specifies the type of diagnostic connector and its pinout.



**2.Reset Button:**

Reset the on-board Atmega chip, please note that the button had been canceled in the latest version.

**3.78L05:**

Provide a stable 5V to the whole system.


**4.Atmega32U4:**

The master of the entire module, mainly used to store data on the TF card or transfer data to the computer through the type C cable. In addition, since it's arduino compatible, you can use it to implement some simple controls, such as triggering a buzzer alarm when the speed exceeds a certain value.


**5.MCP2515:**

Microchip Technology’s MCP2515 is a stand-alone Controller Area Network (CAN) controller that implements the CAN specification, version 2.0B. It is capable of transmitting and receiving both standard and
extended data and remote frames. The MCP2515 has two acceptance masks and six acceptance filters that are used to filter out unwanted messages, thereby reducing the host MCUs overhead. The MCP2515
interfaces with microcontrollers (MCUs) via an industry standard Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI).


**6.MCP2551**

High-Speed CAN Transceiver：The MCP2551 is a high-speed CAN, fault-tolerant device that serves as the interface between a CAN protocol controller and the physical bus. Typically, each node in a CAN system must have a device to convert the digital signals generated by a CAN controller to signals suitable for transmission over the bus cabling (differential output). It also provides a buffer between the CAN controller and the high-voltage spikes that can be generated on the CAN bus by outside sources (EMI, ESD, electrical transients, etc.).


**7.2x8Pin Female Header for GPS module**

See the GPS section for specific pin definitions.

!!! attention
         It should be noted that when assembling the GPS module, please align the white triangle on the development board and the module, otherwise the GPS module may be damaged.


**8.CAN RX/TX Indicator**

**9.Power LED**

**A.Type C USB connector for programming**

**B.User LED, connect to D13**

**C.TF Card slot**

**D.120Ω resister**

ISO 11898 requires a cable with a nominal impedance of 120 Ω; therefore, you should use 120 Ω resistors for termination. If you place multiple devices along the cable, only the devices on the ends of the cable need termination resistors. Figure 1 shows an example of how to terminate a high-speed network.


<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://github.com/Longan-Labs/OBD-II_Slaver_GPS_kit/raw/master/HS_CAN_Termination.gif" /></p>


So if you use this slaver on the end of the CAN bus, you need to solder a 120Ω resister between the two pad, if not just leave them alone. For more detail about the CAN bus protocol, please refer to the
[NI CAN Physical Layer and Termination Guide](http://www.ni.com/white-paper/9759/en/)

**E.ICSP pads for burning bootloader**

## GPS Usage
-----------

The GPS Module use serial port to output the GPS data, you just need to connect this module to your PC via the USB type C cable, using any serial tool such as putty, you will be able to get the GPS data.

Please upload below code to the board,

    void setup()
    {
        pinMode(A3, OUTPUT);
        digitalWrite(A3, HIGH);         // power on
        
        Serial.begin(9600);
        Serial1.begin(9600);
    }


    void loop()
    {
        while(Serial1.available())
        {
            Serial.write(Serial1.read());
        }
    }

The open your serial monitor,

## CAN BUS Usage
-----------

### ***Arduino Code***

We provide an arduino [library for the dev board](https://github.com/Longan-Labs/OBD-II-CAN-BUS-DEV-KIT). 

There're many examples for the library, which is consist of,

* ***send*** - How to send a frame to CAN Bus
* ***recv*** - How to recv a frame from CAN Bus

## HOW TO GET DATA FROM THE CAR
-----------

There's an ***OBDII_PIDs*** sketch in the library. 
Open the sketch and upload it to the board.

Then open the serial monitor, input a PID, then you will get reponse from vehicle, the input should be end with '\n'.
