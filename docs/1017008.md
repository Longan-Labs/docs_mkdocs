The Open Game Station Player kit contains all the parts you need to build an Arduboy game controller.

### ***Kit Contents***
* Game board
* Carduino 32U4
* Buzzer card
* AAA battery card
* OLED display card
* Acrylic spacer plate
* Screws and standoffs

### ***Required Accessories***
* Two AAA batteries (alkaline or rechargable)

### ***Assembly Tools***
* 3mm Allen Wrench (hex key)

## ***Game Board***
The game board provides the base for the game board controller and features all the control buttons that can be found on the original Arduboy game controller. Following figure shows the things you can see on the front of the game board.

* Edge connector slots: Allow to plug cards such as Carduino, buzzer card, OLED display card, AAA battery card.
* Joystick buttons
* Control buttons

The cards provided with the game board kit features following:

* Carduino 32U4: This is the microcontroller of the game board and powered with the Arduino Leonardo bootloader. You can upload any Arduboy game into the Carduino.  
* Buzzer card: Provides sounds for game events
* AAA battery card: Provides portable power to your game controller
* OLED display card: This is the gaming screen.

### ***Assembly***
This section will guide you to through assembling the Open Game Station Player Kit into a complete Arduboy game controller.

* Take the  acrylic spacer plate. If you want, peel the protective paper masking off both sides of the acrylic spacer plate. Alternatively, you can leave the masking on for additional thickness.

* Attach the four brass standoffs onto the acrylic spacer plate. The standoffs should be screwed into the holes from the bottom of the plate. 

* Place the game board on top of the brass standoffs. The standoffs should be screwd into the holes from the top of the game board. 

* Take the AAA battery card, insert two AAA batteries, and plug it in to a vertically mounted edge connector slot as shown in the following figure. The white arrow head printed on the card should be pointing toward the white arrow head printed near the edge connector. Make sure you have the battery card switched to the OFF position. 

* Take the Buzzer card and plug it into a vertically mounted edge connector slot.

* Take the Carduino 32U4 card and plug it into a vertically mounted edge connector slot. Slide the switch on the Carduino to the D7 / 8 (game board) position.

* Take the OLED display card. Remove the protective film by gently pull up on the tab.

* Plug the OLED display card into the horizontally mounted edge connector slot on the game board.

Following figure shows the completed assembly of the Arduboy Game Controller.
