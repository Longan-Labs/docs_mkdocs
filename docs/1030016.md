**CAN-BUS** is a common industrial bus because of its long travel distance, medium communication speed and high reliability. It is commonly found on modern machine tools, such as an automotive diagnostic bus.

This CAN Bus Shield adopts **MCP2515** CAN Bus controller with SPI interface and **MCP2551** CAN transceiver to give your Arduino CAN Bus capability. With an **OBD-II** converter cable added on and the OBD-II library imported, you are ready to build an onboard diagnostic device or data logger.

!!!Note
    Due to transportation considerations, users need to solder the headers after receiving the product. If you have difficulty in soldering, you can contact info@longan-labs.cc after placing the order, and we will solder the header well before shipping.

## Getting Started
-----
Here's a simple example to show you how CAN-BUS Shield works. In this example we need 2 pieces of CAN-BUS Shields as well as Longan Core 01 (or others Arduino UNO like board).

!!!note
    This example is built under [Arduino IDE version 1.8.10](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/OldSoftwareReleases#1.5.x).


**STEP1: What do we need**

|Name|Function|Qty|Link|
|----|--------|---|----|
|CAN Bus Shield|CAN Bus communication | 2 | [GET ONE NOW](https://www.longan-labs.cc/1030016.html) |
|Longan Core 01|Controller|2|[GET ONE NOW](https://www.longan-labs.cc/1040009.html)|

**STEP2: Hardware Connection**

Insert each CAN-BUS Shield into Longan Core 01 (or others Arduino UNO like board), and connect the 2 CAN-BUS Shield together via 2 jumper wires. Shown as below images.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Longan-Labs/docs_mkdocs/master/docs/images/1030012/connection.png)

!!!note
    CAN_H to CAN_H, CAN_L to CAN_L

**STEP3: Software**

Please follow [how to install an arduino library](http://wiki.seeed.cc/How_to_install_Arduino_Library/) procedures to install CAN BUS shield library.


Click [library for CAN Bus Shield](https://github.com/Longan-Labs/Longan_CAN_MCP2515) to download the library.

Install the library to your Arduino IDE when it is downloaded.

One of the node (a node means Longan Core 01 + CAN_BUS Shield) acts as master, the other acts as slaver. The master will send data to slaver constantly.

!!!note
    Each node can act as master before the code being uploaded.

Open the **send** example (**File > Examples > Longan_CAN_MCP2515 > send**) and upload to the **master**.

Open the **recv** example (**File > Examples > Longan_CAN_MCP2515 > recv**) and upload to the **slaver**.

**STEP4: View Result**

Open the Serial Monitor of Arduino IDE(**slaver**), you will get the data sent from the master.
