**CAN-BUS** is a common industrial bus because of its long travel distance, medium communication speed and high reliability. It is commonly found on modern machine tools, such as an automotive diagnostic bus.

This CAN Bus Shield adopts **MCP2515** CAN Bus controller with SPI interface and **MCP2551** CAN transceiver to give your Arduino CAN Bus capability. With an **OBD-II** converter cable added on and the OBD-II library imported, you are ready to build an onboard diagnostic device or data logger.

!!!Note
    For transportation considerations, the plug-in components of the kit are not soldered by default. After you receive the kit, you need to do some soldering work. If necessary, you can also contact info@longan-labs.cc after purchasing the board, then we can send it to you after the board is soldered well.

## Hardware Overview
-----

![](https://github.com/Longan-Labs/CAN_BUS_SHIELD_RES/raw/main/images/hardware_overview.png)

1. **DB9 Interface** - to connect to OBDII Interface via a DBG-OBD Cable.
2. **V_OBD** - It gets power from OBDII Interface (from DB9)
3. **Led Indicator**:
    - **PWR**: power
    - **TX**: blink when the data is sending
    - **RX**: blink when there's data receiving
    - **INT**: data interrupt
4. **Terminal** - CAN_H and CAN_L
5. **Arduino UNO R3 pin out**
6. **ICSP pins**
7. **SD card slot**
8. **120Ω terminal resistor switch**


### **DB9 connector**

The DB9 interface of CAN Bus has two different protocols, OBD and CAN Open. Their definition is as follows,

|pin#|OBD(default)|CAN OPEN|
|----|----|-----------|
|1|GND|N.C|
|2|GND|CAN_L|
|3|CANH|GND|
|4|N.C|N.C|
|5|CANL|GND|
|6|N.C|N.C|
|7|N.C|CAN_H|
|8|N.C|N.C|
|9|CAN_V+|CAN_V+|

If you want to use the OBD protocol, you don't need to make any changes to the hardware.

If you need to use the CAN Open protocol, first we look at the back side of the PCB board, you can see the Pads below,

!!! Note
    The picture shows another board, but it doesn't matter, the operation method is the same.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Longan-Labs/docs_mkdocs/master/docs/images/1030009/CANBED_FD_DB9_SETTING.jpg)

These pads are connected to the OBD side by default. We have to prepare a knife to disconnect the OBD side, and then use an electric soldering iron to solder the CAN Open side of the pads.

## Getting Started
-----
Here's a simple example to show you how CAN-BUS Shield works. In this example we need 2 pieces of CAN-BUS Shields as well as Longan Core 01 (or others Arduino UNO like board).

!!!note
    This example is built under [Arduino IDE version 1.8.10](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/OldSoftwareReleases#1.5.x).


**STEP1: What do we need**

|Name|Function|Qty|Link|
|----|--------|---|----|
|CAN Bus Shield|CAN Bus communication | 2 | [GET ONE NOW](https://www.longan-labs.cc/1030016.html) |
|Longan Core 01|Controller|2|[GET ONE NOW](https://www.longan-labs.cc/1040009.html)|

**STEP2: Hardware Connection**

Insert each CAN-BUS Shield into Longan Core 01 (or others Arduino UNO like board), and connect the 2 CAN-BUS Shield together via 2 jumper wires. Shown as below images.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Longan-Labs/docs_mkdocs/master/docs/images/1030012/connection.png)

!!!note
    CAN_H to CAN_H, CAN_L to CAN_L

**STEP3: Software**

Please follow [how to install an arduino library](http://wiki.seeed.cc/How_to_install_Arduino_Library/) procedures to install CAN BUS shield library.


Click [library for CAN Bus Shield](https://github.com/Longan-Labs/Longan_CAN_MCP2515) to download the library.

Install the library to your Arduino IDE when it is downloaded.

One of the node (a node means Longan Core 01 + CAN_BUS Shield) acts as master, the other acts as slaver. The master will send data to slaver constantly.

!!!note
    Each node can act as master before the code being uploaded.

Open the **send** example (**File > Examples > Longan_CAN_MCP2515 > send**) and upload to the **master**.

Open the **recv** example (**File > Examples > Longan_CAN_MCP2515 > recv**) and upload to the **slaver**.

**STEP4: View Result**

Open the Serial Monitor of Arduino IDE(**slaver**), you will get the data sent from the master.

## ***Get data from a Vehicle***

We can use CANBus Shield to get data from a vehicle, we take the vehicle speed for an example here. 

You can use our products to read data from cars. Here we provide a simple example by which you can read the speed and revs from a car. This is the [OBD-based PIDs protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OBD-II_PIDs). Regarding the deeper technology of OBD, we can't provide support at present. You may need to have some understanding of the car's protocol. After all, we are more of a hardware supplier.


The interface of OBD is as follows,

![](https://www.longan-labs.cc/media/wysiwyg/CAN-Bus-Case-Dimension/Case-Dimension-07.png)

There're 4 pins we need to connect.

|OBD Pin|CANBus Shield PIN|
|-------|----------|
|5. Signal Ground|GND|
|6. CAN(J-2234) High|CANH|
|14. CAN(J-2234) Low|CANL|
|16. Battery Power|VIN|

You can also use our [OBD-II to DB9 Cable](https://www.longan-labs.cc/2020011.html), which is very convenient to connect to OBD.

Upload the following code to the development board, then open the serial monitor, you get the speed from the car now.

    }

    return 0;

    while(!Serial);
    
    // below code need for OBD-II GPS Dev Kit
    // pinMode(A3, OUTPUT);
    // digitalWrite(A3, HIGH);

    while (CAN_OK != CAN.begin(CAN_500KBPS)) {             // init can bus : baudrate = 500k
        Serial.println("CAN init fail, retry...");
        delay(100);
    }
    Serial.println("CAN init ok!");
    set_mask_filt();
}

void loop() {

    int __speed = 0;
    int ret = getSpeed(&__speed);
